# POKROV 1.2.0 Megaplan — Wave Index

Last updated: 2026-08-22
Classification: `ACTIVE_EXECUTION`
Wave status: `PHASE_10_LOCAL_PACKAGE_COMPLETE_PHASE_11_QUEUED`
Release candidate: `NOT_CREATED`

## Outcome

Deliver POKROV 1.2.0 as an evidence-bound release across the platform, active Android/Windows client, core and public release index. The release must close the audited stop-ship defects, establish one signed machine-readable release contract, make connection truth and diagnostics authoritative, ship the canonical Operator Center, reconcile frontend and commercial behavior, and only promote immutable artifacts after exact-candidate gates pass.

Linux and protocol experiments are conditional lanes: Linux may be a beta only after its own daemon/package matrix is proved; FRKN-derived AWG2/Hysteria2 work cannot be advertised as production or RU-ready without exact-candidate RU-origin evidence.

## Authority and lane boundaries

- Platform source and canonical root documentation: `Kiwunaka/portal`, promotion branch `master`.
- Active Android/Windows client: `Kiwunaka/POKROV-app`, promotion branch `main`.
- Core: `Kiwunaka/pokrov-core`, promotion branch `main`.
- Public release index: `Kiwunaka/pokrov`; immutable assets remain GitHub Release evidence.
- This wave is execution state, not product or release authority. Canonical owners must be updated in the WO that changes behavior.
- Current runtime, signing, device, RU-origin and provider proofs remain distinct. A document or local pass is not production proof.

## Execution order

| Phase | Architectural outcome | State | Primary WO |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 | Baseline, authority map, complete execution ledger | Locally proved (`I3`) | `WO-001` |
| 01 | Release manifest, version/provenance contract, CI and stop-ship controls | Release-v2, client adoption, release-bound CI, reproducible dependencies, shared catalog, release identity consumers, current/history separation and cross-repository version truth locally proved; source/release-index boundary and PR-00 contract set implemented at `I2`; external index trust surface verified but blocked at `I1` | `WO-002`, `WO-003`, `WO-003B`, `WO-003C`, `WO-003D`, `WO-003E`, `WO-003F`, `WO-003G`, `WO-003H`, `WO-003I`, `WO-003J` |
| 02 | Typed connection state, proof-driven green state, core ABI and migrations | 004A/004A2, 004B/004B2, 004C and aggregate Gate B locally proved (`I3`); direct cutover and deterministic visual baselines are explicit; ABI v3 is deferred until after 1.2.0; Core release-CI source contract is complete while hosted/exact-candidate DoD remains open | `WO-004`, `WO-004A2`, `WO-004B2`, `WO-004D`, `WO-006I` |
| 03 | Windows/Android runtime boundaries; conditional Linux beta foundation | Locally complete: Windows service/recovery/journal and stack-only crash profile plus Android runtime/private operational producers are proved; Linux explicitly not shipped in 1.2.0 | `WO-005`, `WO-005C4`, `WO-005D4` |
| 04 | Observability, error catalog, redacted bundle and support pipeline | Locally complete (`I3`) for shipped Android/Windows scope, including four-class safe transport failures, active operational producers, Android count-only routing, no-upload short code, signed temporary support mode, encrypted-only manual export and a current 7/7 MSVC native proof for the bounded Windows service journal; Linux remains explicitly not shipped and external custody, runtime and exact-candidate evidence remain open | `WO-006`, `WO-006I`, `WO-006J`, `WO-006K`, `WO-006L` |
| 05 | Portal bounded contexts, payments, HTTP/DB/outbox reliability | Locally complete (`GATE-D` and `ARCH-002` at `I3`); 007G–007I split admin, public/client and Action Intent domain/runtime owners | `WO-007`, `WO-007G`, `WO-007H`, `WO-007I` |
| 06 | Product facts, subscriptions, checkout, offers and attribution | Local source packages: 008A–008G commercial package at `I2`; 008H–008M close active-client generation, copy/public truth, whole-client product facts, subscription state presentation, no-waterfall loading and the complete local subscription/checkout aggregate at `I3`; deployed provider, broad commercial-consistency and exact-candidate gates stay open | `WO-008`, `WO-008H`, `WO-008I`, `WO-008J`, `WO-008K`, `WO-008L`, `WO-008M` |
| 07 | Canonical Operator Center v2 and legacy admin cutover | Local package complete, including the deterministic 75-operation OpenAPI/TypeScript contract, purpose-bound Telegram OIDC Authorization Code plus PKCE login and same-identity step-up for preprovisioned operators, exact retained-bridge permissions and query-suppressed field redaction; live IdP, authenticated exact-candidate readback and cutover/rollback gates remain open | `WO-009`, `WO-009H`, `WO-009I`, `WO-009J` |
| 08 | App, cabinet and marketing UX/accessibility/performance reconciliation | Locally complete; exact-candidate performance/manual gates retained | `WO-010` |
| 09 | Legal-gated, capacity-aware marketing pilot and evidence-based decision | Locally complete (`I3` package); external pilot `NOT_AUTHORIZED` | `WO-011` |
| 10 | FRKN-derived rules; isolated AWG2 PoC, later HY2 decision | Local package complete; exact artifact/device/RU gates open | `WO-012` |
| 11 | Exact-candidate RC matrix, immutable promotion, rollback and go/no-go | Active local preparation; 013C closes explicit release limitations and 013D closes the reversible stable-pointer source contract at local `I3`; candidate not created | `WO-013`, `WO-013C`, `WO-013D` |

The row order is a dependency order, not permission for one giant merge. Each implementation WO must stay repository-scoped and independently reviewable.

## Current evidence

- `BASELINE.json` records repository heads and observed gaps as of 2026-08-21.
- `EXECUTION-LEDGER.csv` is the machine-readable item register; `(plan,id)` is the primary key.
- `EXECUTION-INDEX.md` defines the completion index and aggregate reporting rules.
- `SOURCE-CROSSWALK.md` preserves plan coverage and conflict decisions.

## Collision and promotion gates

- Before each WO: inspect branch/status/diff in every repository in its write scope.
- Never overwrite dirty or concurrent work; use a scoped branch/worktree and stage only authorized files.
- No deployment, production mutation, payment action, campaign launch, external message, branch-protection change or artifact promotion is authorized by this index alone.
- Exact runtime/manual gates use the repository labels: `PASS`, `MANUAL_OWNER_TEST`, `OPERATOR_ATTESTED`, `SKIPPED_BY_OWNER`, `SKIPPED_BY_OPERATOR`, `BLOCKED_BY_ACCESS`, `NOT_REQUESTED`.
- Stable promotion is prohibited while a STOP-SHIP row is below `I4` or any required exact-candidate gate lacks retained evidence.

## Next action

Continue bounded local closure for the 3 rows explicitly staged
`pre_freeze`; 33 candidate, 17 external and 21 deferred rows do not belong to
that local queue. Three external pre-candidate rows remain blocking. Before any
candidate can exist, commit and freeze clean platform/client/Core revisions,
obtain the separate public release-index revision, and replace the pending Core
development artifacts with exact identities. Do not build/sign/promote
artifacts, deploy, mutate a server, enroll a cohort or claim RU readiness
without the separate owner authority and access required by each gate.
